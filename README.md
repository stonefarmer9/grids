# Grids - A learning REPO

## Description

- This repo exists as a way to further investigate and practice my CSS grid skills.

- I have set myself a few challenges to complete:

  1. ~~A grid of 3 boxes - 2 on left, one above the other, one right taking whole column.~~

  2. A grid of 4 boxes each taking up the same area

  3. A grid of 4 boxes in a grid of varying column size

  4. A grid of 4 boxes with varying row size.

  5. A grid of 3 boxes, onClick will open a new box.

  6. onClick opens a new box without affecting the position of the other boxes.

  7. onClick opens a new div with a nested Grid.

  8. A second Onclick function that adds something to the nested grid.

  9. 8, but with no other div being affected.

## Approach

  There is not much of an approach to this project other than completing the challenges set for myself and any other challenges I conjure during.

  Importantly in a break from my other Projects I will not:
      - Test in any way shape or form.
      - Semantic Commits will be gone.
      - SOLID does not exist in this repo
      - Clean Code is not relevant here as repetition is key to learning. 


## Progress

As I progress with these challenges I will write accounts or insert images of the completed challenge.
