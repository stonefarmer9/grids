# Grids - A learning REPO

## Description

- This repo exists as a way to further investigate and practice my CSS grid skills.

- I have set myself a few challenges to complete:

  1. A grid of 3 boxes - 2 on left, one above the other, one right taking whole column.

  2. A grid of 4 boxes each taking up the same area

  3. A grid of 4 boxes in a grid of varying column size

  4. A grid of 4 boxes with varying row size.

  5. A grid of 3 boxes, onClick will open a new box.

  6. onClick opens a new box without affecting the position of the other boxes.

  7. onClick opens a new div with a nested Grid.

  8. A second Onclick function that adds something to the nested grid.

  9. 8, but with no other div being affected.

## Progress

As I progress with these challenges I will write accounts or insert images of the completed challenge.
